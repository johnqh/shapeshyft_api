/**
 * @fileoverview Provider IP sync route
 * @description Points an entity's self-hosted LM Studio providers at whatever
 * address the caller is currently reaching the API from.
 *
 * This exists for a provider running on a home connection with a dynamic IP:
 * the machine calls this endpoint (from a cron job, or on boot) and its stored
 * provider URLs follow it, without anyone editing a dashboard.
 *
 * The address comes from the TCP peer whenever the client reached the API
 * directly. A forwarded header is honoured only when the peer is itself a
 * private address, which means the request arrived through our own reverse
 * proxy -- an attacker on the internet cannot make their connection appear to
 * come from inside the Docker network. See `resolveCallerIp`.
