 * anything once we know the hop that sent it is our own infrastructure. The
 * peer address settles that: an attacker on the internet cannot make their TCP
 * connection appear to originate from a private address.
 *
 * - **Public peer** -- the client reached us directly. Use the peer and ignore
 *   every header, forged or not.
 * - **Private or loopback peer** -- we are behind our own reverse proxy
 *   (Traefik on the Docker network, in this deployment). Read the client from
 *   the forwarded headers it set.
 *
 * On the trusted branch the headers are consulted in a deliberate order:
 *
 * 1. `CF-Connecting-IP` / `True-Client-IP` -- a CDN's own client header, which
 *    it overwrites on every request and a client therefore cannot forge.
 * 2. `X-Forwarded-For`, read **right to left**, taking the first public entry.
 *    Each proxy appends the address that connected to it, so the right-hand
 *    entries were written by trusted infrastructure while the leftmost may have
 *    come from the client.
 * 3. `X-Real-Ip`.
 *
 * The CDN header must come first, and this is not theoretical. On
 * api.shapeshyft.ai the chain is Cloudflare -> Traefik -> API, and Traefik has
 * no `forwardedHeaders.trustedIPs`, so it *discards* Cloudflare's
 * `X-Forwarded-For` and rewrites it with the Cloudflare edge address. That edge
 * address is public, so every "is this routable" check passes and it looks like
 * a perfectly good client IP -- it just is not one, and it changes from request
 * to request. `CF-Connecting-IP` is the only header in that chain carrying the
 * real client.
